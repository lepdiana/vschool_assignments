    <h3>History</h3>
    <div id="content2">
        <p>Golden Retrieves originated in Sccotland in the 19th century. They got their name from retieving shot
            waterfowls like ducks during hunting and shooting games without damaging the item received due to their soft
            mouth.</p>

    <h3>Types of Golden Retrievers</h3>
    <div id="content3">
        <h4>American</h4>
        <p>American Golden Retrievers' hair are lankier in comparison to the British and Canadian. Their coats are
            typically darker than the British. They are less muscular than the other varieties. Generally, their eyes
            are lighter in color and they are also triangular instead of round.</p>
        <h4>British</h4>
        <p>British Golden Retrievers have long and feathery coats. The difference between the British and American are
            small. They have similar sizes and coats. Thus, their temperaments are roughly similar. However, the
            difference between these two is their build. British Goldens have a broader skull and more powerful
            forequarters. They will also have rounder, darker eyes. In contrast to the Canadians, they are somewhat
            smaller but not by much.</p>
        <h4>Canadian</h4>
        <p>Canadian Golden Retrievers look the most different out of the three types of Golden Retrievers. Their hair is
            shorter and thinner than its counterpartsâ€™ coats. Additionally, it is not as feathery. On average, these
            dogs are two inches taller. This makes this dog the most different among the three.</p>
