            <p className="weatherText">As with many other parks in the West, Zion National Park weather is dependent on season and elevation. In the summer, temperatures reach 100 degrees or more on the canyon floor and top out in the nineties at higher elevations. Fast moving thunderstorms can cause flash floods during this period. Spring and fall normally feature warm days and cool nights; however, there's always a chance of a late spring or early summer snowstorm. Zion sees most of its precipitation in the winter with temperatures ranging from 50 degrees during the day to below freezing at night.</p>
            <h2 className="tourCampingTitle">Tours and Camping</h2>
            <p className="tourCampingText">Zion National Park camping, hiking and backpacking are available to park guests. Other outdoor adventures include biking along Zion Canyon Scenic Drive and rafting along the Virgin River. Guests in search of more leisurely activities can partake in Zion park ranger-led events, join a guided horseback tour or watch for one of the 285 bird species recorded in the park. Park guests can stop by the Zion Canyon Visitor Center to pick up a Zion National Park Map.

            Zion Park is open 24 hours a day, year round. However, some attractions may be closed during inclement weather or colder seasons. A weekly admission pass is $25 per vehicle or $12 for individuals. Zion National Park camping is available at three developed, frontcountry sites for a fee and reservations are required. Guests looking for more luxurious accommodations within the park can stay at Zion Lodge. While there is no additional booking fee, it’s recommended that reservations are made should you wish to stay at the lodge's cabins.</p>
            <h2 className="wildlifeTitle">Wildlife</h2>
            <p className="wildlifeText">Zion has a large and varied ecosystem, due largely in part to the expansive and diverse landscape it inhabits. Visitors can expect to see lizards, mule deer, and wild turkeys, and hopefully won’t run into some of the more dangerous animals, like mountain lions or rattlesnakes, on their vacations.</p>
